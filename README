== Requirements ==
 - gcc
 - gnuplot
 - latex

== Compilation ==
cd /path/to/project
make
make report
make report # Run twice to resolve references

== Usage ==
To view usage instructions, just run `./md` in a shell. The available
simulation commands will be shown.

== Tools ==
The 'tools' directory contains some premade scripts for plotting the
data that comes out of the 'md' program. A short description of each
follows:

 - `./tools/avg-msd.sh`
   Plots the mean square distance of the particles over time at a
   range of temperatures (3d plot).
 
 - `./tools/energy-cons.sh`
   Plot the total energy as a function of time.
 
 - `./tools/fcc-pos.sh`
   Plot the positions of atoms in a FCC lattice.
 
 - `./tools/lj-pos.sh`
   Plot the positions of atoms in a simple 2-particle Lennard-Jones
   potential.
 
 - `./tools/temp-energy.sh`
   For a single temperature, plot the energy of the system as a
   function of time.
 
 - `./tools/temp-response.sh`
   Generate a plot of the energy as a function of temperature.
   
 - `./tools/vel-dist.sh`
   Generate a histogram of a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution.
